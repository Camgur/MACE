Lmod has detected the following error: The following module(s) are unknown:
"cudann"

Please check the spelling or version number. Also try "module spider ..."
It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore_cache load "cudann"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string
#%Module
