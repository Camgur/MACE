This is the plan for the MACE project as of 2024-08-22.

General outline: A pipeline has been created to optimise 
the geometry and allow a user to select two atoms to perform 
NEB calculations on using MACE. The program will then perform 
the optimisation of the NEB calculation.

A secondary experiment that is very promising has been set up 
for the geometry optimisation. MACE seems to be in good 
agreement with Quantum Espresso DFT relaxation when it comes 
to the minimum energy configuration. Actual energies may not 
be super reliable, however (unsure).

The relaxed structures are then assesed by Quantum Espresso 
for NMR parameters, which are within 0.02 ppm of difference 
for LiAlO2 (!!). This indicates that it may be possible to 
replace the DFT relaxation with a fully MACE-base to get a 
quick optimisation good for most applications. NMR is a good 
test for the validity of the model.


What has been done?

NMR and NEB calculations have been performed for LiAlO2 with 
good results.


What remains?

Run more crystals, essentially (use CC)
Validate the theory with experimental data
Try to validate NEB method with DFT or alike


To do:

	- Double check: is it possible to calculate NMR from purely electron densities?
	- Get more crystals (between 5-10 to put in the system)
		- Can look at SE_calc paper for inspiration
		- Ask Gillian for relevant crystals (i.e., things that would be useful)
		- Also things we have experimental data on (esp. already published)
	- 1-page report (dirty, showing time of experiments, etc, and good data)
		- Rodrigo will send to Gillian to see if we can continue along with the thesis
		- Only need to have time to calculate raw data, can put it together when have time
		- Rodrigo is very flexible, doesn't want to bog down my experimental time with Linda's samples
	- Polish up the NEB framework to push to a GitHub repo
		-Send a paper to Rodrigo on how this is used in practice
